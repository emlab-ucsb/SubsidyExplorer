For Overfished: 1) There is uncertainty regarding the status of many fish stocks. 2) For the purposes of modeling this proposal, we assume that subsidies to fishing on stocks identified as overfished (B/Bmsy < 1) in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database are prohibited. 3) The proportion of stocks identified as overfished in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database likely underestimates the actual proportion of stocks that are overfished globally, but it is unclear whether enough evidence would exist to trigger this prohibition for stocks not included in this database. 4) The proposal is ambiguous about which reference points might be used to make an overfished determination, and we therefore note that this is only one very narrow possible interpretation of this text. 5) Additionally, as written, this text includes two alternate definitions for an overfished stock subsidy prohibition - we have chosen to model the more ambitious interpretation of the two. For OFOC: 1) We assume that all capacity-enhancing and ambiguous subsidies as defined by Sumaila et al. 2019 are prohibited to vessels fishing in areas beyond that Member's national jurisdiction. 2) We note that this is an ambitious interpretation of this proposal, as the text makes it clear that the fact that a subsidy is granted is not reason enough for that subsidy to be prohibited. However, data does not exist at present to make this determination for subsidy programs globally. 3) By default, we consider all capacity-enhancing subsidies provided to vessels spending at least 5% of their total annual effort fishing on the high seas and/or in the EEZs of another coastal state to be prohibited. For Cap: 1) 1) We assume that each Member's base for capping is represented by the total amount of capacity-enhancing and ambiguos subsidies estimated by Sumaila et al. 2019. 2) Members are sorted into three tiers based on a three-year average of FAO marine capture production (2016-2018). Members accounting for 0.7% or more of global marine capture production are in ""Tier 1""; Members accounting for 0.05% or more, but less than 0.7%, of global marine capture production are in ""Tier 2""; Members accounting for less than 0.05% of global marine capture production are in ""Tier 3"". 3) This proposal advocates for allowing both Tier 1 and Tier 2 Members to negotiate their own subsidy caps or to accept a default cap of $50 million annually. For the purposes of modeling, we assume that Tier 1 Members receive a subsidy cap equal to 50% of their base for capping; Tier 2 Members receive the default cap of $50 million; Tier 3 Members do not receive a cap.

Therefore each Member's base subsidy level is represented by the total amount of all other capacity-enhancing and ambiguous subsidies estimated by Sumaila et al. 2019. 2) we estimate the landed value of marine capture fisheries from the FAO Global Capture Production Database. 3) We assume the de minimis limit for developed and developing country members belonging to the top 10 marine capture fisheries producers to be 10% of the average total landed value of the Member's marine capture fisheries between 2016-2018.
