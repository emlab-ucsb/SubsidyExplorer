","This communication presents a draft text on subsidies for fishing overfished stocks. It aims to eliminate text no longer under consideration and consolidate the remaining possible alternative approaches that have been put forth or discussed. It is noted that this is in no way agreed text, but rather an attempt to try to focus future discussions. It advocates for prohibiting subsidies for fishing on an overfished stock. It provides two alternative approaches for crafting such a prohibition: subsidies shall be prohibited 1) if there is a lack of recovery of the stock or if there is a continuous reduction in the level of the stock; 2) if they are not implemented in a manner that ensures rebuilding of the stock.  It also provides two possible ways of characterizing and determining what constitutes an overfished stock: 1) those recognized as such by the Member under whose jurisdiction the fishing is taking place or by the relevant RFMO/A; 2) those for which the mortality from fishing needs to be restricted to allow the stock to rebuild to some reference point. ",No,"1) There is uncertainty  regarding the status of many fish stocks. 2) To model the proposal we assume that subsidies to fishing on stocks identified as overfished (B/Bmsy < 0.8) in the RAM Legacy stock assessment database are prohibited. 3) The proportion of stocks identified as overfished in the RAM Legacy stock assessment database likely underestimates the actual proportion of stocks that are overfished globally, but it is unclear whether enough evidence would exist to trigger this prohibition for stocks not included in this database. 4) The proposal is ambigious about which reference points might be used to make an overfished determination, and we therefore note that this is only one very narrow possible interpretation of this text.

Yes,Overfished,"Our interpretation of this is a conservative one.  I understand that there is no possibility to model flexibilities to territorial waters and the rest of the EEZ.

It builds on ACP text proposal TN/RL/GEN/192, as reflected in TN/RL/W/274/Rev.6, and advocates for a prohibition on subsidies to vessels fishing outside of a Member's territorial sea on overfished stocks. It defines overfished stocks as those recognized as such by the Member in whose jurisdiction the fishing is taking place, or by the relevant RFMO/A. It also provides a list of allowed subsidies.

Yes,Overfished,"Our interpretation of this is the same as that provided for the Facilitator's working paper. Yes, I think the facilitator's text builds on this proposal. Australia makes the case for the casual link negative effects. The discussion right now is moving toward the Facilitators report.

It is very similar to some of the draft text provided in RD/TN/RL/119, and advocates for a prohibition on subsidies for fishing on stocks recognized as overfished by the Member under whose jurisdiction the fishing is taking place or by the relevant RFMO/A. Such subsidies shall be prohibited if they are found to be having a negative effect on the stock, defined as any of the following: 1) a lack of recovery of the fishery; 2) continuation of depletion of fish stock levels; 3) continuation of excess levels of fishing. ",No,"There is uncertainty  regarding the status of many fish stocks. To model the proposal we assume that subsidies to fishing on stocks identified as overfished (B/Bmsy < 0.8) in the RAM Legacy stock assessment database are prohibited. The proportion of stocks identified as overfished in the RAM Legacy stock assessment database likely underestimates the actual proportion of stocks that are overfished globally, but it is unclear whether enough evidence would exist to trigger this prohibition for stocks not included in this database. Additionally, as written, this text requires that there be a causal negative effect to the stock as a result of the subsidy. This is difficult to establish given existing data on subsidy provisioning and stock status, and is not possible to model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,oa1,all,,,,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ii) their individual share exceeds 2% of the annual global marine capture;
iii) they engage in distant water fishing (if normally fishes in a FAO area);
