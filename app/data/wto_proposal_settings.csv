It was intended to provide a starting point for interactive discussion. As written, it provides two possible ways of characterizing and determining what constitutes an overfished stock: i) those recognized as such by the Member under whose jurisdiction the fishing is taking place or by the relevant RFMO/A; ii) those for which the mortality from fishing needs to be restricted to allow the stock to rebuild to some reference point. Additionally, it includes a blank placeholder for inclusion of a cap-based proposal.","For IUU: Subsidies granted by developing and LDC Members shall be allowed for small scale fishing: a) for unreported and unregulated fishing: b) within their own territorial waters.

Users are free to explore a more ambitious interpretation by making their own assumptions about expected IUU-findings. 4) No proportionality or the duration of prohibition is considered. For Overfished: 1) There is uncertainty  regarding the status of many fish stocks. 2) For the purposes of modeling this proposal, we assume that subsidies to fishing on stocks identified as overfished (B/Bmsy < 0.8) in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database are prohibited. 3) The proportion of stocks identified as overfished in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database likely underestimates the actual proportion of stocks that are overfished globally, but it is unclear whether enough evidence would exist to trigger this prohibition for stocks not included in this database. 4) The proposal is ambiguous about which reference points might be used to make an overfished determination, and we therefore note that this is only one very narrow possible interpretation of this text. 5) Additionally, as written, this text includes two alternative definitions used to identify an overfished stock - this is the less ambitious interpretation of the two (see Overfished - Negative effects (Option A)).  For OFOC: 1) We assume that all capacity-enhancing and ambiguous subsidies as defined by Sumaila et al. 2019 are prohibited to vessels fishing in areas beyond that Member's national jurisdiction. 2) We note that this is an ambitious interpretation of this proposal, as the text makes it clear that the fact that a subsidy is granted is not reason enough for that subsidy to be prohibited. However, data does not exist at present to make this determination for subsidy programs globally. 3) By default, we consider all capacity-enhancing subsidies provided to vessels spending at least 5% of their total annual effort fishing on the high seas and/or in the EEZs of another coastal state to be prohibited.

It was intended to provide a starting point for interactive discussion. As written, it provides two possible ways of characterizing and determining what constitutes an overfished stock: i) those recognized as such by the Member under whose jurisdiction the fishing is taking place or by the relevant RFMO/A; ii) those for which the mortality from fishing needs to be restricted to allow the stock to rebuild to some reference point. Additionally, it includes a blank placeholder for inclusion of a cap-based proposal.","For IUU: Subsidies granted by developing and LDC Members shall be allowed for small scale fishing: a) for unreported and unregulated fishing: b) within their own territorial waters.

Users are free to explore a more ambitious interpretation by making their own assumptions about expected IUU-findings. 4) No proportionality or the duration of prohibition is considered. For Overfished: 1) There is uncertainty  regarding the status of many fish stocks. 2) For the purposes of modeling this proposal, we assume that subsidies to fishing on stocks identified as overfished (B/Bmsy < 1) in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database are prohibited. 3) The proportion of stocks identified as overfished in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database likely underestimates the actual proportion of stocks that are overfished globally, but it is unclear whether enough evidence would exist to trigger this prohibition for stocks not included in this database. 4) The proposal is ambiguous about which reference points might be used to make an overfished determination, and we therefore note that this is only one very narrow possible interpretation of this text. 5) Additionally, as written, this text includes two alternative definitions used to identify an overfished stock - this is the more ambitious interpretation of the two (see OFOC - Negative effects (Option A)). For OFOC: 1) We assume that all capacity-enhancing and ambiguous subsidies as defined by Sumaila et al. 2019 are prohibited to vessels fishing in areas beyond that Member's national jurisdiction. 2) We note that this is an ambitious interpretation of this proposal, as the text makes it clear that the fact that a subsidy is granted is not reason enough for that subsidy to be prohibited. However, data does not exist at present to make this determination for subsidy programs globally. 3) By default, we consider all capacity-enhancing subsidies provided to vessels spending at least 5% of their total annual effort fishing on the high seas and/or in the EEZs of another coastal state to be prohibited. For Cap: 1) We assume that provision of the following types of subsidies as defined by Sumaila et al. 2019 are allowed to continue irrespective of a Member's total de minimus limit: i) fisher assistance programs; ii) rural fishers' community development programs.subsidies (both programs relevant to fishing in territorial waters). Therefore each Member's base subsidy level is represented by the total amount of all other capacity-enhancing and ambiguous subsidies estimated by Sumaila et al. 2019. 2) we estimate the landed value of marine capture fisheries from the FAO Global Capture Production Database. 3) We assume the de minimis limit for developed and developing country members belonging to the top 10 marine capture fisheries producers to be 10% of the average total landed value of the Member's marine capture fisheries between 2016-2018. For all other developing country Members, we assume the de minimis limit to be 20% of the average total landed value between 2016-2018.

The baseline of reductions is to be the annual average monetary value of fisheries subsidies (3 prior years or 1 year -optional) minus exempted subsidies (cessation, stock protection, artisanal fishing in 12nm zone, disaster relief). It specifies cumulative ranges (8 ranges: 0-15mn to over 1,2bn) of subsidies in monetary value. Members falling in each range will be subject to a specific percentage reduction in total fisheries subsidies (from 0% to 15% and then to 45% in increments of 5). The total subsidy reduction shall equal the sum of the cuts on each range, the upper ranges carry larger reduction obligations. The proposal contains a default option of $25mn in cases where a Member fails to notify to establish the baseline. It also provides for a flexibility for Members with a baseline below $25mn that could be uplifted by $5mn under certain considitions (timebound, MSY and capture limit).","As written, if a Member's baseline is lower than USD 25mn and the Member demonstrably needs to develop capacity to fish in their own EEZ, they shall be entitled an ""uplift"" of USD 5 mn (i.e., their subsidies limit shall be USD 30mn). The ""uplift"" shall last until one of the following conditions is met: the percentage of the fish caught within that Member's EEZ by vessels flying that Member's flag reaches 75 % of the total catch; or the Member has attained capacity to fish at MSY or alternative reference points within its own EEZ. The Member who benefits from the ""uplift"" shall notify, every two years, the percentage of fish caught in its EEZ by vessels carrying its flag.

The criteria to consider the exemption is low income, resource poor or livelihood fishing to ensure food security and limited to 12 nautical miles and applicable dometic legislation.","For IUU: Subsidies granted by developing and LDC Members shall be allowed for small scale fishing: a) for unreported and unregulated fishing: b) within their own territorial waters. Transition periods are also considered as an alternative but are not modeled here. For Overfished: Subsidies granted by all Members for fishing within their own territorial sea shall be allowed. Transition periods are also considered as an alternative but are not modeled here.

Transition periods are also considered as an alternative but are not modeled here. If transition periods were employed, we assume that LDCs would enjoy a transition period specifically for them. ","This data underlying this tool only includes vessels that transmit AIS, primarily vessels 24 meters in length or larger. This tool therefore doesn't capture the vast majority of small scale vessels as they don't usually have AIS. Tor this reason is difficult to simulate an exception to artisanal or small scale fisheries. However, the tool is able to model the impact of the fishing in the 12 nautical miles from all Members providing a proxy to what it would mean to exclude fishing in the 12 nautical miles from the prohibition.
