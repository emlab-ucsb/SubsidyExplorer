As written, it still provides two possible options for S&DT for Article 5 prohibitions. For the purposes of modeling here, we use ALT 1.  ","For IUU: Subsidies granted by developing and LDC Members shall be allowed for small scale fishing within their own territorial waters. Such an exemption might only apply for a transition period of 2 years, but we model it as if such an exemption would continue indefinitely. For Overfished: Subsidies granted by developing and LDC Members shall be allowed for small scale fishing within their own territorial waters. Such an exemption might only apply for a transition period of 2 years, but we model it as if such an exemption would continue indefinitely. For OCOF: Subsidies granted by LDCs shall be allowed, and subsidies granted by developing countries shall be allowed for fishing in their territorial seas, or for fishing in their EEZs and high seas unless any of the following conditions are met for three consecutive years (2016-2018): a) GNI per capita is greater than US $5000 (constant 2010 US$), b) they engage in distant water fishing, or c) the contribution from Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing to their national GDP (World Bank) is greater than 10%. Transition periods are also considered as an alternative but are not modeled here. If transition periods are employed, LDCs would enjoy a transition period specifically for them.","For IUU: 1) Final determinations are made by existing RFMO/A vessel lists, and by flag and coastal Member states. 2) No publically available data exist for most flag Members, nor for coastal Members. 3) The possible effects is a conservative interpretation of this text. Users are free to explore a more ambitious interpretation by making their own assumptions about expected IUU-findings. 4) No proportionality or the duration of prohibition is considered. For Overfished: 1) There is uncertainty  regarding the status of many fish stocks. 2) For the purposes of modeling this proposal, we assume that subsidies to fishing on stocks identified as overfished (B/Bmsy < 0.8) in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database are prohibited. 3) The proportion of stocks identified as overfished in the RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database likely underestimates the actual proportion of stocks that are overfished globally, but it is unclear whether enough evidence would exist to trigger this prohibition for stocks not included in this database. 4) The proposal is ambiguous about which reference points might be used to make an overfished determination, and we therefore note that this is only one very narrow possible interpretation of this text. 5) The definition for an overfished stock subsidy prohibition considered here is the less ambitious interpretation considered in the previous version of the text. For OFOC: 1) We assume that all capacity-enhancing and ambiguous subsidies as defined by Sumaila et al. 2019 are prohibited to vessels fishing in areas beyond that Member's national jurisdiction. 2) We note that this is an ambitious interpretation of this proposal, as the text makes it clear that the fact that a subsidy is granted is not reason enough for that subsidy to be prohibited. However, data does not exist at present to make this determination for subsidy programs globally. 3) By default, we consider all capacity-enhancing subsidies provided to vessels spending at least 5% of their total annual effort fishing on the high seas and/or in the EEZs of another coastal state to be prohibited. For Cap: None.","<ol><li>Final determinations are made by existing RFMO/A vessel lists, and by flag and coastal Member states.</li><li>No publically available data exist for most flag or coastal Members.
