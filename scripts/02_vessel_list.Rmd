# Introduction 

This script creates the global vessel list used in the SubsidyExplorer toolkit. It requires access to the raw Global Fishing Watch (GFW) data stored on BigQuery (not-publically available), as well as a valid Google Cloud Console billing account. It outputs a single data file to `r here::here("results", "02-vessel-list")`: 

- vessel_list_2018_raw.csv

It also creates a 1x1 degree version for use in making higher resolution figures. This is output to 

```{r}
# Load packages
library(knitr) 
library(countrycode) # country name matching
library(bigrquery) # access Bigquery from R
#devtools::install_github("r-dbi/bigrquery")
library(tidyverse)

# Path to cleaned subsidies data file
subsidy_dat_sumaila_path <- here::here("data", "edited", "sumaila_et_al_2019_subsidies_tidy.csv")

# Path to cleaned landings data file

```

```{r}

# Directories for the output files generated by this script

if (dir.exists(results_dir) == F) {

}

# Extract good fishing vessels from existing vessel info table

This section describes the process of linking to the most recent version of the GFW vessel information table, and pulling information on all likely fishing vessels represented in that dataset. This process was last performed on `r format(Sys.time(), '%B %d, %Y')`. 

The vessel info table we're using (`world-fishing-827.gfw_research.vi_ssvid_byyear_v20190430`) has all sorts of stuff in it, so there are some basic filters we need to apply. 

First, we remove all transmissions from objects that are likely fishing gear (buoys, nets, etc.), rather than vessels. 

Second, we apply a number of filters to remove ids associated with non-fishing, inactive, and spoofing vessels:
- MMSI must be on the best fishing vessel list
- MMSI cannot be used by 2+ vessels with different names simultaneously
- MMSI cannot be used by multiple vessels simultaneously for more than 3 days
- MMSI has not been found to be offsetting its position
- MMSI vessel class can be inferred by the neural net (i.e. it is an active vessel)
- MMSI was active for at least 1 day and fished for at least 1 hour in a year
- MMSI is associated with fewer than five shipnames

Finally, GFW has manually compiled a list of vessel IDs that are bad, so we exclude those. 

```{r}
sql <- "WITH

# Extract fishing effort for good fishing vessels

## By 1x1 degree latititude/longitude 

We first extract the number of hours spent fishing by each of our good fishing vessels in each 5x5 degree latitude/longitude bin from the raw fishing effort table (`world-fishing-827.gfw_research.pipe_v20190502_fishing`). 

To identify valid fishing effort here, we apply the following filters: 
- The fishing activity must have occured during a valid segment as identified by GFW.
- The fishing activity must have occured during a segment with more than 10 positions that was not concurrently overlapping with another, longer, segment for the same MMSI.  
- The vessel performing the fishing activity must appear on the list of good fishing vessels created above

We then extract a vessel table with the the following attributes: 
- year (int): Year. Matches our data year specified above.
- lat_bin_center (int): 1 degree latitude bin, coordinates refer to the center of the bin
- lon_bin_center (int): 1 degree longitude bin, coordinates refer to the center of the bin
- fao_region (int): Major FAO statistical region
- fishing_hours_lat_lon: Total annual fishing hours in the specified lat/lon bin by a single vessel
- ssvid (chr): Unique vessel identification number given by GFW (MMSI number for most vessels)
- flag (chr): Best flag state of the vessel
- engine_power_kw (int): Best engine power of the vessel

## By EEZ and/or FAO region

We then extract the number of hours spent fishing by each of our good fishing vessels in different EEZs and/or FAO regions from the raw fishing effort table (`world-fishing-827.gfw_research.pipe_v20190502_fishing`).

To identify valid fishing effort, we apply the following filters:
- The fishing activity must have occured during a valid segment as identified by GFW.
- The fishing activity must have occured during a segment with more than 10 positions that was not concurrently overlapping with another, longer, segment for the same MMSI.  
- The vessel performing the fishing activity must appear on the list of good fishing vessels created above

We then extract a vessel table with the the following attributes: 
- year (int): Year. Matches our data year specified above.
- eez_id (chr): EEZ identifier. 
- fao_region (int): Major FAO statistical region
- fishing_hours_eez_fao: Total annual fishing hours in the specified eez and/or fao region by a single vessel
- ssvid (chr): Unique vessel identification number given by GFW (MMSI number for most vessels)
- flag (chr): Best flag state of the vessel. 
- vessel_class (chr): Best vessel type. 
- length_m (dbl): Best vessel length in meters.
- tonnage_gt (dbl): Best vessel tonnage in gross tons. 
- engine_power_kw (dbl): Best engine power in killowatt hours.

# Correct outdated flag codes and Identify EU and USA dependent vessels

Before allocating catches and subsidies across vessels, we need to do some manual corrections for incorrect flag codes and we need to identify vessels flagged to states that are overseas dependencies of the EU or USA. We assume that these vessels recieve subsidies from their sovereign states. 

```{r}

```

```{r}
# Get table of all flag states in the GFW data
gfw_flags <- effort_good_fishing_vessels_2018 %>%
  distinct(flag) %>%
  mutate(flag_name = countrycode(flag, "iso3c", "country.name"))

```


```{r}

vessel_list$flag[vessel_list$flag == "ROM"] <- "ROU"
vessel_list$flag[vessel_list$flag == "UNK"] <- NA
```

# Allocating Catches and Subsidies

Before we allocate catches and subsidies, we need to get total fishing kWh by flag and FAO region, as well as by flag. 

```{r}
# Effort by flag and fao
effort_flag_fao <- vessel_list %>%
  group_by(flag, fao_region) %>%
  summarize(fishing_KWh = sum(fishing_KWh_eez_fao, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Effort by flag
effort_flag <- effort_flag_fao %>%
  group_by(flag) %>%
  summarize(fishing_KWh = sum(fishing_KWh, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

We then need to get total catches and revenues per fishing KWh by flag and FAO region, as well as by flag. We first will assign catch rates for FAO region/flag combinations that appear in both the GFW and FAO data. For FAO region/flag combinations that don't appear in the FAO data, we will allocate the remainder?

```{r}
# Load catch and revenue data
catch_flag_fao <- read_csv(catch_dat_path) %>%
  dplyr::filter(year == 2017) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!(iso3 %in% c("EU", "USA-T", "UNK"))) %>%
  group_by(iso3, area, variable) %>%
  summarize(value = sum(value, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  spread(variable, value) %>%
  dplyr::filter(landings > 0)

catch_flag <- catch_flag_fao %>%
  group_by(iso3) %>%
  summarize(landings = sum(landings, na.rm = T),
            revenue = sum(revenue, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

First, we identify flag states in the GFW data that do not have reported catches. 

```{r}
# effort_flag
effort_no_matching_catches <- effort_flag %>%
  dplyr::filter(!(flag %in% catch_flag$iso3))

# There are 3 flag states for which we don't have reported catch data at all: CXR (Christmas Island), LIE (Liechtenstein) and NA (no flag). We're going to try assigning them based on the EEZ in which they spend the most time fishing instead. 
vessels_new_flag <- vessel_list %>%
  dplyr::filter(flag %in% effort_no_matching_catches$flag) %>% # 773 entries 
  dplyr::filter(eez_id != 0) %>% # remove high seas entries
  group_by(ssvid) %>%
  top_n(1, fishing_KWh_eez_fao) %>%
  summarize(new_flag = unique(territory1_iso3))  #486 vessels

# So  there are 75 vessels that have no flag and that only fish on the high seas... We'll be excluding those vessels
vessel_info_new_flag <- vessel_list %>%
  dplyr::filter(ssvid %in% vessels_new_flag$ssvid) %>%
  left_join(vessels_new_flag, by = "ssvid") %>%
  mutate(flag = new_flag) %>%
  dplyr::select(-new_flag) # 688 entries

# Fix vessel list 
vessel_list <- vessel_list %>%
  dplyr::filter(!(flag %in% effort_no_matching_catches$flag)) %>%
  bind_rows(vessel_info_new_flag) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(flag))
vessel_list$flag[vessel_list$flag == "ESH"] <- "MAR"
vessel_list$flag[vessel_list$flag == "CPT"] <- "FRA"
```

Turns out they all do! 

```{r}
# And we redo one last time
effort_flag_fao <- vessel_list %>%
  group_by(flag, fao_region) %>%
  summarize(fishing_KWh = sum(fishing_KWh_eez_fao, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Effort by flag
effort_flag <- effort_flag_fao %>%
  group_by(flag) %>%
  summarize(fishing_KWh = sum(fishing_KWh, na.rm = T)) %>%
  ungroup()

# effort_flag
effort_no_matching_catches <- effort_flag %>%
  dplyr::filter(!(flag %in% catch_flag$iso3))
```

Now that we don't have any flags with no associated catch, we can start calculating catch rates by flag and FAO statistical area.  

```{r}
# Let's get region specific catch rates we can use for when we don't have matching flag/fao pairs
catch_region_no_match <- catch_flag_fao %>%
  anti_join(effort_flag_fao, by = c("iso3" = "flag", "area" = "fao_region")) %>%
  mutate(join_region = case_when(area == 88 ~ 58,
                                      TRUE ~ area)) %>%
  group_by(join_region) %>%
  summarize(tot_landings = sum(landings, na.rm = T),
            tot_revenue = sum(revenue, na.rm = T))

# Get matching catch/effort flag and fao region pairings
match_effort_catch <- effort_flag_fao %>%
  left_join(catch_flag_fao, by = c("flag" = "iso3", "fao_region" = "area")) %>%
  arrange(flag, fao_region) %>%
  mutate(is_match = ifelse(!is.na(fishing_KWh) & !is.na(landings), T, F))

# # Extract those flag/fao pairings for which we have matching entries to calculate catch rates
match <- match_effort_catch %>%
  dplyr::filter(is_match) %>%
  mutate(catch_per_fishing_KWh = landings/fishing_KWh,
         revenue_per_fishing_KWh = revenue/fishing_KWh) %>%
  dplyr::select(flag, fao_region, catch_per_fishing_KWh, revenue_per_fishing_KWh)

# # Extract those flag/fao pairings for which we have matching entries to calculate catch rates
no_match <- match_effort_catch %>%
  dplyr::filter(is_match == F)

# Get leftover rates
rates_no_match <- no_match %>%
  mutate(join_region = case_when(fao_region == 18 ~ 21,
                                 fao_region == 67 ~ 77,
                                 fao_region == 47 ~ 41,
                                 TRUE ~ fao_region)) %>%
  full_join(catch_region_no_match, by = c("join_region")) %>%
  group_by(join_region) %>%
  mutate(tot_fishing_KWh = sum(fishing_KWh, na.rm = T),
         catch_per_fishing_KWh = tot_landings/tot_fishing_KWh,
         revenue_per_fishing_KWh = tot_revenue/tot_fishing_KWh) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(fao_region) %>%
  summarize(catch_per_fishing_KWh = unique(catch_per_fishing_KWh),
            revenue_per_fishing_KWh = unique(revenue_per_fishing_KWh))
  
# Add back in to our flag/fao pairings
no_match <- no_match %>%
  left_join(rates_no_match, by = c("fao_region")) %>%
  dplyr::select(flag, fao_region, catch_per_fishing_KWh, revenue_per_fishing_KWh)

# Combine
catch_rates_flag_fao_all <- match %>%
  bind_rows(no_match)
```

And now we can apply those catch rates to our vessel list. 

```{r}
vessel_list <- vessel_list %>%
  left_join(catch_rates_flag_fao_all, by = c("flag", "fao_region"))
```

The process for allocating subsidies is slightly more straightforard as we only have data by flag

```{r}
# Load subsidy data
subsidies_dat <- read_csv(subsidy_dat_path) %>%
  dplyr::filter(year == 2018)

# Summarize total subsidies by type and flag
subsidies_flag <- subsidies_dat %>%
  group_by(iso3, type) %>%
  summarize(value = sum(value, na.rm = T)) %>%
  spread(type, value)

subsidy_types <- unique(subsidies_dat$type)
good_subsidy_types <- c("A1", "A2", "A3")
ugly_subsidy_types <- c("C1", "C2", "C3")
bad_subsidy_types <- c("B1", "B2", "B3", "B4", "B5", "B6", "B7")

# Resummarize effort including overseas territories with their sovereign
effort_flag_revised <- effort_flag %>%
  mutate(flag_for_matching = case_when(flag %in% c("USA", us_territories) ~ "USA",
                              flag %in% c("FRA", french_territories) ~ "FRA",
                              flag %in% c("GBR", uk_territories) ~ "GBR",
                              flag %in% c("NOR", norwegian_territories) ~ "NOR",
                              flag %in% c("DNK", danish_territories) ~ "DNK",
                              flag %in% c("NLD", dutch_territories) ~ "NLD",
                              TRUE ~ flag)) %>%
  group_by(flag_for_matching) %>%
  mutate(tot_fishing_KWh = sum(fishing_KWh, na.rm = T))
                          
# Calculate subsidy rates by flag
subsidy_rates_flag <- effort_flag_revised %>%
  left_join(subsidies_flag, by = c("flag_for_matching" = "iso3")) %>%
  group_by(flag) %>%
  summarize_at(subsidy_types, list(per_fishing_KWh = ~./tot_fishing_KWh))
subsidy_rates_flag[is.na(subsidy_rates_flag)] <- 0

# Join back to vessel_list
vessel_list <- vessel_list %>%
  left_join(subsidy_rates_flag, by = c("flag"))

```

Now we can calculate total catches, revenues, and subsidies by type for each vessel

```{r}
rename_me <- function(x){
  str_replace(x, "_per_fishing_KWh", "")
}

vessel_list <- vessel_list %>%
  mutate(catch = fishing_KWh_eez_fao*catch_per_fishing_KWh,
         revenue = fishing_KWh_eez_fao*revenue_per_fishing_KWh) %>%
  mutate_at(paste0(subsidy_types, "_per_fishing_KWh"), list(subs = ~.*fishing_KWh_eez_fao)) %>%
  rename_at(paste0(subsidy_types, "_per_fishing_KWh_subs"), rename_me) %>%
  dplyr::select_at(vars(-contains("_per_fishing_KWh"))) %>%
  mutate(good_subs = rowSums(select(., one_of(paste0(good_subsidy_types, "_subs")))),
         bad_subs = rowSums(select(., one_of(paste0(bad_subsidy_types, "_subs")))),
         ugly_subs = rowSums(select(., one_of(paste0(ugly_subsidy_types, "_subs")))))

write_csv(vessel_list, paste0(results_dir, "vessel-list-2018-raw.csv"))
```
