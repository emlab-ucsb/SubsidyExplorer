# Introduction 

This script generates the most ambitous global and regional results obtained by removing all capacity enhancing subsidies from all WTO Members and Observers.

```{r}
# Source model script


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
